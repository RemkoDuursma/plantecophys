\description{
A coupled photosynthesis - stomatal conductance model, based on the 
Farquhar model of photosynthesis, and a Ball-Berry type model of stomatal conductance. 
Includes options for temperature sensitivity of photosynthetic parameters, day respiration 
(optionally calculated from leaf temperature), and mesophyll conductance.
}
\details{
The coupled photosynthesis - stomatal conductance model finds the intersection between 
the supply of CO2 by diffusion, and the demand for CO2 by photosynthesis. See Farquhar and 
Sharkey (1982) for basic description of this type of model, Duursma (2015) for more details 
on the implementation in the \code{plantecophys} package, and Duursma et al. (2014) for an 
example application (that uses this implementation).

\strong{Photosynthesis model and temperature response} - 
The model of Farquhar et al. (1980) is used to estimate the dependence of leaf net 
photosynthesis rate (ALEAF) on intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci), accounting for all 
three limitations (electron transport, carboxylation, and TPU limitation). The equations 
for the temperature response of photosynthetic parameters, including Vcmax, Jmax, 
Gammastar, and Km follow Medlyn et al. (2002). However, \strong{note that the default 
temperature response parameter values are not taken from Medlyn, and likely will have to 
be adjusted for your situation}. \strong{Warning} : since package version 1.4, the default 
parameters have been adjusted. The new parameter values (EaV, EdVJ, delSJ, etc.) were based 
on a comprehensive literature review. See vignette("new_T_responses") or the article on 
remkoduursma.github.io/plantecophys.

#'  By default, the \code{Photosyn} function returns the hyperbolic minimum of Vcmax and 
Jmax-limited photosynthetic rates, as well as the hyperbolic minimum of Jmax-limited and 
TPU-limited rates. This approach avoids the discontinuity at the transition between the 
two rates (thus allowing use of \code{Photosyn} and \code{fitaci} in optimization or 
fitting routines). The individual rates (Ac, Aj and Ap) are also returned as output 
should they be needed. Note that those rates are output as gross photosynthetic rates 
(leaf respiration has to be subtracted to give net leaf photosynthesis).

\strong{Coupled leaf gas exchange}
 When Ci is not provided, Ci is calculated from the intersection between the 'supply' and 
 'demand', where 'demand' is given by the Farquhar model of photosynthesis (A=f(Ci)), and 
 supply by the stomatal conductance. The latter is, by default, estimated using the 
 stomatal conductance model of Medlyn et al. (2011), but two other models are provided 
 as well (Ball-Berry and Leuning, see \code{gsmodel} argument). Otherwise, stomatal 
 conductance may be directly provided via the \code{GS} argument. 

 \strong{Stomatal conductance models} -  
 At the moment, three stomatal conductance models are implemented. The 'BBOpti' model 
 is a slightly more general form of the model of Medlyn et al. 2011 (see Duursma et al. 
 2013). It is given by (in notation of the parameters and output 
 variables of \code{Photosyn}),
 
 \deqn{GS = g0 + 1.6*(1 + g1/D^(1-gk))*ALEAF/CA}
 
 where \code{gk = 0.5} if stomata behave optimally (cf. Medlyn et al. 2011).
 
 The 'BBLeuning' model is that of Leuning (1995). It is given by,
 
 \deqn{GS = g0 + g1*ALEAF/(Ca * (1 + VPD/D0))}
 
 Note that this model also uses the g1 parameter, but it needs to be set to 
 a much higher value to be comparable in magnitude to the BBOpti model.
 
 The 'BallBerry' model is that of Ball et al. (1987). It is given by,
 
 \deqn{GS = g0 + g1*RH*ALEAF/Ca}
 
 Where RH is relative humidity. Again, the g1 value is not comparable to that 
 used in the previous two models.
 
 Finally, \code{Photosyn} provides a very flexible Ball-Berry model, where 
 the multiplier has to be specified by the user, the model is:
 
 \deqn{GS = g0 + BBmult*ALEAF}
 
 This interface can be used to quickly simulate what happens if stomata do 
 not respond to humidity at all (in which case BBmult=g1/Ca, or ca. 5/400), or 
 to use the Tuzet model of stomatal conductance inside another model that provides 
 the leaf water potential function.
 
 For the full numerical solution to the Cowan-Farquhar optimization, use 
 the \code{\link{FARAO}} function (which was used in Medlyn et al. 2011 for 
 comparison to the approximation there presented). See Duursma (2015) for more details.
 
 \strong{Mesophyll conductance} - 
 
 If the mesophyll conductance \code{gmeso} is provided as an input, it is assumed 
 that Vcmax and Jmax are the chloroplastic rates, and leaf photosynthesis is 
 calculated following the equations from Ethier and Livingston (2004). When very 
 low mesophyll conductance rates are input, the model may return poor solutions 
 (and sometimes they may not exist).
 
 \strong{Simulating A-Ci curves}
 
 If Ci is provided as an input, this function calculates an A-Ci curve. For 
 example, you may do \code{Photosyn(Ci=300)}, for which the function \code{Aci} 
 is included as a shortcut (\code{Aci(300)}).
 
\strong{Atmospheric pressure} - 

A correction for atmospheric pressure (Patm) is implemented in \code{\link{fitaci}}, 
but \strong{not in Photosyn}. In \code{fitaci}, the necessary corrections are applied 
so that estimated Vcmax and Jmax are expressed at standard pressure (Patm=100kPa). 
In Photosyn, however, the corrections are much more complicated and tend to be very 
small, because effects of Patm on partial pressures are largely offset by increases 
in diffusivity (Terashima et al. 1995, Gale 1973). 

Note that Patm is an argument to the Photosyn function, but it only affects 
calculations of Km and GammaStar (as used by fitaci), and transpiration rate. 
Setting only Patm \strong{does not correct for atmospheric pressure effects on 
photosynthesis rates}.

The simulation of limitation of the photosynthetic rate to triose-phosphate 
utilization follows details in Ellsworth et al. (2015), their Eq. 7. Note that 
the parameter \code{alphag} is set to zero by default.
