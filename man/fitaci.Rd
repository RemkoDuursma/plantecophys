\description{
Fits the Farquhar-Berry-von Caemmerer model of photosynthesis to measurements of 
photosynthesis and intercellular \eqn{CO_2}{CO2} concentration (Ci). Estimates Jmax, Vcmax, Rd 
and their standard errors. A simple plotting method is also included, as well as the function 
\code{\link{fitacis}} which quickly fits multiple A-Ci curves (see its help page). Temperature 
dependencies of the parameters are taken into account following Medlyn et al. (2002), see 
\code{\link{Photosyn}} for more details.
}
\details{
\subsection{Fitting method}{The default method to fit A-Ci curves (set by 
\code{fitmethod="default"}) uses non-linear regression to fit the A-Ci curve. No assumptions 
are made on which part of the curve is Vcmax or Jmax limited. Normally, all three parameters 
are estimated: Jmax, Vcmax and Rd, unless Rd is provided as measured (when \code{useRd=TRUE}, 
and Rd is contained in the data). This is the method as described by Duursma (2015, Plos One).

The 'bilinear' method to fit A-Ci curves (set by \code{fitmethod="bilinear"}) linearizes 
the Vcmax and Jmax-limited regions, and applies linear regression twice to estimate first 
Vcmax and Rd, and then Jmax (using Rd estimated from the Vcmax-limited region). The transition 
point is found as the one which gives the best overall fit to the data (i.e. all possible 
transitions are tried out, similar to Gu et al. 2010, PCE). The advantage of this method is that 
it \emph{always} returns parameter estimates, so it should be used in cases where the default 
method fails. Be aware, though, that the default method fails mostly when the curve contains 
bad data (so check your data before believing the fitted parameters).

When \code{citransition} is set, it splits the data into a Vcmax-limited (where Ci < citransition), 
and Jmax-limited region (Ci > citransition). Both parameters are then estimated separately for 
each region (Rd is estimated only for the Vcmax-limited region). \bold{Note} that the actual 
transition point as shown in the standard plot of the fitted A-Ci curve may be quite different 
from that provided, since the fitting method simply decides which part of the dataset to use 
for which limitation, it does not constrain the actual estimated transition point directly. 
See the example below. If \code{fitmethod="default"}, it applies non-linear regression to 
both parts of the data, and when fitmethod="bilinear", it uses linear regression on the 
linearized photosynthesis rate. Results will differ between the two methods (slightly).}

The 'onepoint' fitting method is a very simple estimation of Vcmax and Jmax for every point 
in the dataset, simply by inverting the photosynthesis equation. See De Kauwe et al. (2016) 
for details. The output will give the original data with Vcmax and Jmax added (note you can 
set \code{Tcorrect} as usual!). For increased reliability, this method only works if 
dark respiration (Rd) is included in the data (\code{useRd} is set automatically when 
setting \code{fitmethod='one-point'}). This method is not recommended for full A-Ci curves, 
but rather for spot gas exchange measurements, when a simple estimate of Vcmax or Jmax 
is needed, for example when separating stomatal and non-stomatal drought effects on 
photosynthesis (Zhou et al. 2013, AgForMet). The user will have to decide whether the Vcmax 
or Jmax rates are used in further analyses. This fitting method can not be used in \code{fitacis}, 
because Vcmax and Jmax are already estimated for each point in the dataset.

\subsection{TPU limitation}{Optionally, the \code{fitaci} function estimates the triose-phosphate 
utilization (TPU) rate. The TPU can act as another limitation on photosynthesis, and can be 
recognized by a 'flattening out' of the A-Ci curve at high Ci. When \code{fitTPU=TRUE}, the 
fitting method used will always be 'bilinear'. The TPU is estimated by trying out whether the 
fit improves when the last n points of the curve are TPU-limited (where n=1,2,...). When TPU is 
estimated, it is possible (though rare) that no points are Jmax-limited (in which case estimated 
Jmax will be NA). A minimum of two points is always reserved for the estimate of Vcmax and Rd. 
An additional parameter (\code{alphag}) can be set that affects the behaviour at high Ci (see 
Ellsworth et al. 2015 for details, and also \code{\link{Photosyn}}). See examples.}

\subsection{Temperature correction}{When \code{Tcorrect=TRUE} (the default), Jmax and Vcmax 
are re-scaled to 25C, using the temperature response parameters provided (but Rd is always 
at measurement temperature). When \code{Tcorrect=FALSE}, estimates of all parameters are at 
measurement temperature. If TPU is fit, it is never corrected for temperature. Important 
parameters to the fit are GammaStar and Km, both of which are calculated from leaf temperature 
using standard formulations. Alternatively, they can be provided as known inputs. \strong{Warning} : 
since package version 1.4, the default parameters have been adjusted. The new parameter values 
(EaV, EdVJ, delSJ, etc.) were based on a comprehensive literature review. See 
\code{vignette("new_T_responses")} or the article on remkoduursma.github.io/plantecophys.}

\subsection{Mesophyll conductance}{It is possible to provide an estimate of the mesophyll 
conductance as input (\code{gmeso}), in which case the fitted Vcmax and Jmax are to be interpreted 
as chloroplastic rates. When using gmeso, it is recommended to use the 'default' fitting 
method (which will use the Ethier&Livingston equations inside \code{Photosyn}). It is also 
implemented with the 'bilinear' method but it requires more testing (and seems to give 
some strange results). When gmeso is set to a relatively low value, the resulting fit 
may be quite strange.}

\subsection{Other parameters}{The A-Ci curve parameters depend on the values of a number 
of other parameters. For Jmax, PPFD is needed in order to express it as the asymptote. If 
PPFD is not provided in the dataset, it is assumed to equal 1800 mu mol m-2 s-1 (in which 
case a warning is printed). It is possible to either provide PPFD as a variable in the 
dataset (with the default name 'PARi', which can be changed), or as an argument to 
the \code{fitaci} directly.}

\subsection{Plotting and summarizing}{The default \strong{plot} of the fit is constructed 
with \code{\link{plot.acifit}}, see Examples below. When plotting the fit, the A-Ci curve 
is simulated using the \code{\link{Aci}} function, with leaf temperature (Tleaf) and PPFD 
set to the mean value for the dataset. The \strong{coefficients} estimated in the fit 
(Vcmax, Jmax, and usually Rd) are extracted with \code{coef}. The summary of the fit is 
the same as the 'print' method, that is \code{myfit} will give the same output as 
\code{summary(myfit)} (where \code{myfit} is an object returned by \code{fitaci}).

Because fitaci returns the fitted \code{\link{nls}} object, more details on statistics of 
the fit can be extracted with standard tools. The Examples below shows the use of the 
\pkg{nlstools} to extract many details of the fit at once. The fit also includes the 
\strong{root mean squared error} (RMSE), which can be extracted as \code{myfit$RMSE}. This 
is a useful metric to compare the different fitting methods.}

\subsection{Predicting and the CO2 compensation point}{The fitted object contains two functions 
that reproduce the fitted curve exactly. Suppose your object is called 'myfit', then 
\code{myfit$Photosyn(200)} will give the fitted rate of photosynthesis at a Ci of 200. 
The inverse, calculating the Ci where some rate of photosynthesis is achieved, can be done with
\code{myfit$Ci(10)} (find the Ci where net photosynthesis is ten). The (fitted!) CO2 
compensation point can then be calculated with : \code{myfit$Ci(0)}}.

\subsection{Atmospheric pressure correction}{Note that atmospheric pressure (Patm) is taken 
into account, assuming the original data are in molar units (Ci in mu mol mol-1, or ppm). 
During the fit, Ci is converted to mu bar, and Km and Gammastar are recalculated accounting 
for the effects of Patm on the partial pressure of oxygen. When plotting the fit, though,
 molar units are shown on the X-axis. Thus, you should get (nearly) the same fitted curve when
  Patm was set to a value lower than 100kPa, but the fitted Vcmax and Jmax will be higher. 
  This is because at low Patm, photosynthetic capacity has to be higher to achieve the same 
  measured photosynthesis rate.}
